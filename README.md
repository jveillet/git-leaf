# git-leaf

git-leaf is a command line utility for creating git branches using a convention, written in Rust.
It can be used as a Git plugin for convenience.

This project is a Rust playground, it might not be helpful to you, it's an OSS project so you might tweak it as you want.

## Description

git-leaf is an executable that takes an issue name, could be a JIRA ticket number, a Github issue number,..
And a title, which is a simple string sentence, representing your issue title.

The output will be a git branch with a name formated with the concatenation of the issue name + title.
The whitespace will be replaced by underscores, and only the first letter of the sentence will be capitalized.

## Prerequisites

You will need a version of the Rust Programming language (>= 1.28.0), it should come with Cargo, the Rust packet manager.
See the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) for more details.

This project is known to work on On linux Debian 9, MacOS High Sierra and Mojave.

Feel free to test it on another OS and open issues if needed.

### Dependencies

You will need a working version of git installed on your system.
Note that it is already provided in the Dockerfile.

## Installing

```bash
$ git clone git@gitlab.com:jveillet/git-leaf.git
$ cd git-leaf
$ cargo install --path .
```

This will install the binary in the `~/.cargo/bin`.

You can add this path to your OS path `$PATH` in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin"

```
By doing this, you will also get `git` integration for free, neat! :)

```
$ git leaf -h
```
